Civil Usage Public License

The Civil Usage Public License is an open source licence that disallows the usage of software for harming or killing people and any usage for spyware or secret monitoring.
The license allows the usage of software in closed source and commercial software as long as a copy of the license conditions is distributed together with the final product.
Distributions of adjusted sources are allowed as long as modified files carry prominent notices that are stating that the files have been changed.
The conditions for derivative licenses are stated in the file LICENSE here as well.
